# Git Tutorial: Part II (Under development)
In this tutorial, we will cover the slightly more advanced concepts of version control such as managing branches, contributing to open source projects, and further reading.

## Branches
Concisely ([Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell)), 
> Branching means you diverge from the main line of development and continue to do work without messing with that main line. 

A line of development can be thought of a series of commits where changes are made progressively. 
Branching can be used for various purposes, such as feature development, collaboration, etc. Here are two examples where that might be useful: 

1. In our project, you were working on your idea for an app and your friend was working on their idea. The two of you are technically working of your own branches on the code without affecting the branch present on Github (i.e., the remote branch).

2. Say you were
